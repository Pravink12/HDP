# H_D_Prediction
# Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, pulse rate, and other health factors.  
It applies machine learning techniques to analyze the input data and classify whether the person is at risk of heart disease or not.

## Features
- Input health parameters (BP, cholesterol, pulse, etc.)
- Predicts risk of heart disease
- User-friendly interface for entering details
- Built with machine learning algorithms

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn / Machine Learning
- Pandas, Numpy
- (Add Flask/Streamlit if you used for UI)

## Project Structure
- `dataset/` : Contains dataset used for training
- `model/` : Trained model files
- `app.py` : Main application script
- `requirements.txt` : List of dependencies

## How It Works
1. User provides health-related inputs.
2. The model processes the input data.
3. Predicts whether the person has a risk of heart disease or not.

## Usage
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py

Heart Disease Prediction project that takes health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, pulse rate, and other factors as input, then predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease using machine learning.
